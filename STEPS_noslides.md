# DEMO STEPS

## Introduction

- Aurora, web dev, norway, consultant at Inmeta in oslo
- Excited to speak remotely today at React Summit US, because i'll be teaching you how to elevate speed, interactivity and user experience with React Server Components.
- I will be coding something inspired by a feature iâ€™ve built for my current consultancy project, where im actively using React Server Components.

## Setup and starting point

- This is a project task manager sort of thing.
- The setup is Next.js App router, prisma and an Azure DB, tailwind CSS.
- Demo app, new tab: Very slow load, slowed down data fetches on purpose.
- But, it's actually not bad. Try out tabs, try search with a basic form, see the result in the table.
- This is all server components, which means there is no js shipped to the client for these components. Just html, navigations and a form, and things work without js.
- Good base case, will work even if we are on a device with low processing power that cannot run JS efficiently.

## Review lighthouse scores

- Open pre-run lighthouse screen. Show impact of each by hovering circle.
- FCP: Bad since we are showing nothing until all server components are done.
- LCP: Bad, out LCP is shown same time as our FCP.
- Speed index bad since it measures incrementally how much content is shown, but we have nothing until everything is shown.
- TBT: 0 since no JS, responsive page, no uncanny valley since default elements.
- CLS: 0 since everything is painted at once.
- Overall metrics are bad but actually not the worst because we have no js to get high TBT and no moving elements to get high CLS.
- However the app feels terrible on initial load because we are waiting for everything to render on the server and only getting the default browser spinner.

## Go through the code

- Async layout.tsx server component
- Show the different data files just querying a db and using cookies() and slow()
- Mention each component in the file, children:
- Async [tab] page.tsx server components, we are querying our db based on filters directly based on the filters inside this server component.
- Dynamic requests, static is easy because this could be run in the build, but this is dynamic data. We have to await at runtime.
- Basically, want we want to do is elevate the speed, interactivity and UX of this app, and improve the web vitals that are bad without worsening the good ones.

## Improve the UX when switching tabs

- Lets improve the UX of these tabs.
- Tabs are navigating but very slowly, because we are waiting for the await for the table data in page.tsx to finish.
- Suspense will allow us to mark something as lower priority and non-blocking, and show a fallback while waiting for finish, and then stream it in.
- Let's unblock the page.tsx by adding loading.tsx inside /[tab] to create an implicit suspense boundary. Now it can navigate instantly. Go to "todo" tab.

## Improve data fetching in layout.tsx

- For the initial load, I'm blocked by the awaits in the layout and I cant show anything on the screen.
- Layout.tsx fetches are running sequentially even though they don't depend on each other.
- The first through might be to run them in parallel with promise.all().That would help, but you would still be blocked in the layout.
- So, let's push the data fetches down from the layout to the components themselves.
- Move projectDetails fetch to projectDetails.tsx, and move tabs fetch to tabs.tsx. Each component is now responsible for their own data, making them composable.
- Display suspense fallbacks with "loading..." around projectDetails, and around tabs. - Show the result: streaming in the RSCs using just a little js as they complete on the server. Running in parallel, have a lower total load timem and utlitizes the shared compute load between server and client. We can actually show something on the screen and even interact with what we have (fill search).
- If we turn off the slow the suspense boundaries would be mostly omitted.
- Open CWV: We fixed the FCP and LCP since we are showing the project information right away and not blocking the page, and LCP is our FCP which is the project information and its very fast. (Our LCP is still slowed down but greatly improved).
- However, did you see how the elements are visually unstable as they load. We got cumulative layout shift. Unconfortable UX. CLS is no longer 0, and is very impactful on our scores.ments are visually unstable as they load. We got cumulative layout shift. Unconfortable UX.
- We have to make loading fallbacks the right size. Replace with skeletons.
- Showcase the improved CLS. Managed 0-0.1 since my skeletons are good, but not perfect and will often be hard to obtain with dynamically sized content.
- Suspense Search because SearchParams witch skeleton because SearchParams opt into dynamic rendering.

## Improve UX

Let's move to improving the UX, it is still not good here. We are not seeing active tab and the search is doing a full page reload.

### Mark active tab and read promise with use in Tabs.tsx

- Let's start by showing the currently active tab. Add useParams and get active tab. Make client component. We cannot have this async now, we have to fetch the data outside. Put the data outside.
- But we don't want to get back to blocking our layout. Lets remove the await and pass it down to the Tabs as a promise.
- Then we can read the promise with use() which will resolve it, and the component will suspend the same way allowing us to see the fallback.
- Now we can see the active tabs and navigate between them.

### Add a loading spinner to Search.tsx

- Uncomfortable experience in the search.
- Progressive enhancement of the base case search with onChange, we want to push to the router. Add router, params, and searchParams.
- Add "use client", newSearchParams, pushRouter.
- Using the existing search params because I will be adding more in the next step.
- We are keeping the state in the URL as a single source of truth, because the state of the app will be reloadable, shareable, and bookmarkable.
- Add defaultvalue and reset with a key.
- Notice the url is updating later because we are waiting for the await in the table to resolve before routing.
- As a user, we want to know that something is happening in the app.
- Explain useTransition: mark a state update as non-urgent and non-blocking and get pending state.
- Use pending state to display user while waiting for the navigation to finish, which is the await in the table component. Reload.
- Enable the spinner, while we are transitioning, we can see it.
- When this is hydrated by js, we have the progressive enhcanement of the onchange and the spinner.
- (Using a transition also batches the key strokes, leaving only one entry in the history.)

## Add CategoryFilter.tsx to layout.tsx

- Add the CategoryFilter component to layout.tsx. It takes in a categories promise and reads it with use. Pass it down with a new data fetch and suspend with a disabled toggle button.
- This component is filtering with searchParams again, using the URL as the state again. However when we click the tabs, we don't see anything happening.
- Pay attention to the URL. It's not updating until the new table in page.tsx is done with its await query and finished rendering on the server. Therefore we cannot see the active filters right away.
- Let's mark the loading state. Add startTransition around router.push. How can we use this isPending?
- Show class group in layout, show pseudo-class group-has data-pending in page.tsx.
- Show the result. Pending feedback while showing stale content instead of nothing.
- Instead of creating a global state manager, we can just use css. Add data-pending=isPending attribute.
- But i also want responsive buttons, and were gonna use useOptimistic - it is a great tool to handle this. It will take in a state to show no action is pending, which is our "truth" of the url, and return an optimistic value and a trigger function.
- Add useOptimistic to CategoryFilter.tsx. Set them inside the transition while waiting for the router to resolve. Showcase.
- UseOptimistic will create a optimistic client state, but then throw away it away after the transition completes. The categories are instant and don't depend in the network. Refreshing the page will show the correct state.
- Credit to Sam Selikoff with his post on buildui blog for this pattern.
- (Batchign again, only updating once we are done selecting, leaving only one entry in the history.)

## Cache() getCategoriesMap in categories.ts

- We are fetching the categories twice for every render - once for the task summary and once for the category filter. Show terminal logs 2x.
- We can deduplicate this since it's running in the same render.
- Add cache() higher order React 19 function to getCategoriesMap in categories.ts. Notice load time.
- The load time is actually reduced by 500ms because the StatusTabs and the CategoryFilter are using the same return value of getCategoriesMap. And you can see it's only run once. Show terminal logs 1x.
- This means that can keep using our common pattern of fetching data inside components, similar to how we would use for example tanstack query in a client side app.

## Final demo

- See content right away, and interact with tabs while streaming in the server components as they finish rendering on the server. And we have some nice caching here.
- Reload, even filter while streaming, enable "testing" and "backend".
- Greatly improved UX. Even though the data fetches are still extremely slow, the app feels super responsive.
- Search for "api". Reload/share/bookmark the page and have the same state.
- And this is very robust: progressively enhanced the no-js base case, and just added a low amount of js, using it only where needed. (No race conditions because of useTransitions batching.)
- No useEffects or useStates in sight. We are making interactive apps without that in this new world of React Server Components.

## Review lighthouse scores again

- Open the tab in new window with pre-run scores localhost. Hover scores. Or rerun?
- Again, the LCP and FCP are much improved since the first run because they are both the project information, but we can also see that the speed index improved since we show start off with more content, the project information, before showing incrementally more content, as seen in filmstrip.
- We can also maintained the TBT of 0, which corresponds to the responsive clicks because we have minimal JS and no long tasks.
- Maintained 0 CLS because of these skeletons being sized correctly.
- We have greatly improved performance, getting 95-100 score in lighthouse even with a 2s second total load time application.
- We managed to complete our task of improving the bad metrics and maintaining the good metrics, while also making app fast, interactive and user-friendly.

That's it for this talk, the code is pinned on my github, and follow me on twitter if you are interested in more RSC content. Thanks for listening!
